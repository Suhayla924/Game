  <h1>GLITCHED MEMORIES: A GAME</h1>
  <p> We all have special and joyous moments in our lives and often wish that we could relive those moments. We can in our memories! We can remember every detail wether it be big or small and recalling each person who was there. The memories
    immortalized in your mind, never to be forgottenâ€¦ Or can they? The human mind is malleable and can easily change or forget a memory. Those memories often erode and change away with the sands of time, glitching our memories of better times.

  <p>Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrows to move the figure back and forth across the screen.
    Use the SPACE BAR to jump up and down. As you collect more hourglasses, more time passes. When you collect flopydisks you regan some of your memories, turning back your time passed.
